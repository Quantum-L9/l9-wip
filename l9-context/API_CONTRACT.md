# Capability contract: l9-context

**Implementation proposal, not a live API inventory.** Gate action names below are canonical candidates. Payload specimens are intentionally separate from the SDK-owned transport. Authentication, tenant, correlation and transport lineage remain in the validated transport context. Per-action payload and result schemas are supplied as implementation proposals for owner review; memory request/receipt semantics continue to bind to the existing owner contract.

| Action | Request specimen | Core result specimen | Effect | Semantics |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| context.compile | ContextNeed | ContextBundle | read | Fulfill deterministic context requirements from authorized owner capabilities through Gate. |
| context.refresh | ContextRefreshRequest | ContextDelta | read | Re-evaluate bound source changes against an exact prior bundle digest and current authorization. |
| context.explain | ContextExplainRequest | ContextExplainResult | read | Return provenance, omissions, requirement coverage and ranking explanations for an authorized bundle. |

## Common boundary obligations

Every request validates authenticated role, effective scope, purpose, action grant, contract identity, size and deadline before effects. A payload scope is a request, never a grant. Domain write requests bind operation identity and request digest; exact replay returns the original authoritative result and mismatch conflicts. Read pagination has explicit limits/cursors and reports coverage. Service errors distinguish invalid request, forbidden, not found, conflict, unavailable, deadline, partial and outcome unknown. No generic success boolean is sufficient.

### context.compile

Fulfill deterministic context requirements from authorized owner capabilities through Gate. No profile-owned authority invented by retrieval or model ranking.

**Receipt obligation:** bind action/operation, authenticated scope, owner contract, input digest and observed outcome. For reads report source coordinates, bounds and omissions. For mutations report committed revision or authoritative destination receipt. Transport acceptance alone never satisfies semantic completion.

**Negative proof:** l9context-api-1: refuse scope/contract mismatch and do not perform undeclared effects.

**Capability-specific completion:** see CAPABILITY_DETAILS.md and tests named in TEST_PLAN.md. Dependencies must fail visibly without bypass.

### context.refresh

Re-evaluate bound source changes against an exact prior bundle digest and current authorization. Delta refuses wrong scope/profile/base; no unchanged recursive refresh loop.

**Receipt obligation:** bind action/operation, authenticated scope, owner contract, input digest and observed outcome. For reads report source coordinates, bounds and omissions. For mutations report committed revision or authoritative destination receipt. Transport acceptance alone never satisfies semantic completion.

**Negative proof:** l9context-api-2: refuse scope/contract mismatch and do not perform undeclared effects.

**Capability-specific completion:** see CAPABILITY_DETAILS.md and tests named in TEST_PLAN.md. Dependencies must fail visibly without bypass.

### context.explain

Return provenance, omissions, requirement coverage and ranking explanations for an authorized bundle. No hidden chain-of-thought and no source content leak through diagnostics.

**Receipt obligation:** bind action/operation, authenticated scope, owner contract, input digest and observed outcome. For reads report source coordinates, bounds and omissions. For mutations report committed revision or authoritative destination receipt. Transport acceptance alone never satisfies semantic completion.

**Negative proof:** l9context-api-3: refuse scope/contract mismatch and do not perform undeclared effects.

**Capability-specific completion:** see CAPABILITY_DETAILS.md and tests named in TEST_PLAN.md. Dependencies must fail visibly without bypass.

## Owner acceptance before implementation

This pack includes operation-specific read pages, inspect/status selectors, cancellation and lifecycle requests, claim and acknowledgment receipts, and exact-base context refresh requests. The owner contract PR must verify every shape against its behavioral contract, publish versioned schema/model parity and bind errors to the existing canonical transport. Memory remains deliberately mapped to its existing public request/receipt models; the wrapper shell never substitutes for owner validation. Proposed schemas do not certify runtime behavior.
